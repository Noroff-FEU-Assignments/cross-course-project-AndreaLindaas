    <p id="web-security-answer">
      There are some ways to protect clients websites from intruders by applying web security best practices. 

      They include:
      <ul>
        <li>Network security to protect the exchange of data across the network from breaches, intrusions and other threats.</li>
        <li>sanitization of data which secures the data a system accepts by making sure it is in the right format. This can be done manually or by using a third-party solution.</li>
        <li>secure authorization and authentication so it is hard to crack. To achieve this it is wise to use an open-standard authorization protocol or framework such as OneLogin etc.</li>
        <li>Make sure to do research on any third party application you use.</li>
        <li>Use Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD) to automate processes like code tests, security checks and deployment of the application. </li>
        <li>implementation of automatic user timeout to protect the users data.</li>
     
      </ul>
